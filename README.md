# A-Comprehensive-Study-On-Underwater-Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks
This paper studies deep learning models, YOLOv8 and YOLOv9, for detecting underwater trash in real-time. Evaluating their performance on a large dataset, the research suggests this technology can be integrated into autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to aid in marine cleanup and conservation efforts.
