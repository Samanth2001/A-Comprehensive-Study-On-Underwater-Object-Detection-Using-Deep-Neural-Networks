# A-Comprehensive-Study-On-Underwater-Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks


## Project Description
This repository presents a comprehensive study and implementation of deep learning models for real-time underwater object detection, with a specific focus on identifying marine debris. The project leverages state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) architectures, specifically YOLOv8 and YOLOv9, to accurately and efficiently detect trash and other objects in challenging underwater environments. The primary goal is to provide an effective, scalable, and deployable solution that can be integrated into Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to assist in large-scale marine conservation and cleanup efforts.

## Key Features
Advanced YOLO Architectures: Implementation and comparison of the latest YOLO models (YOLOv8 and YOLOv9) for underwater object detection.

Custom Dataset Integration: Utilizes the TrashCan 1.0 dataset, a large collection of labeled underwater images, for training and evaluating the models.

Real-Time Performance: The trained models are optimized for real-time inference, making them suitable for live video feeds from underwater drones.

Performance Metrics: Detailed analysis of model performance using key metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).

Model Comparison: The repository includes a comparative study of YOLOv8 and YOLOv9, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses on different class datasets.

Deployment-Ready Code: The codebase is structured for easy deployment, allowing researchers and developers to quickly integrate the models into their own projects.

## Results and Analysis
This section will showcase the performance results of the trained models, including visualizations of detected objects, performance charts, and a summary of the findings. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in mitigating the impact of ocean pollution.
